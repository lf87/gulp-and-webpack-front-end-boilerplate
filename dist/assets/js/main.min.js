// Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:

// It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
// It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
// It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.

// When the below is set to true, the comment below enables use strict globally
